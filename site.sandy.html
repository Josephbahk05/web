    Sandy is a sleepy support brawler. It has no known gender. Sandy's basic attack is a spray of sand that deals moderate damage. Sandy's super allows any teammate inside its area, to be enveloped in a sandstorm of invisibility. Similar to Leon's super, invisibility renders friendlies unseenable to enemies. Sandy has mdoerately high health and has great abilities, that really help Sandy's super be more effective in battle. Sandy has star powers, causing all friendlies to gain health or take damage. Sandy's gadget allows for Sandy to finally get some sleep and be restored to full health.
