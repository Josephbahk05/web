    </h2>
    <p>
      Leon is a stealthy assassin, who shoots a quick salvo of fidget spinners. His super allows his to go invisible for a little while. Leon has high offensive capabilities, and can easily destroy tanks and squishies alike. He has mediocre heath, and an excellent set of utilities. His star powers allow him to have increased speed when invisible or insane levels of regen when invisible. His gadgets give him a clone that acts as a meat shield.
