      Amber
    </h2>
    <p>
    Amber is a firebreathing, insane damage dealing, and masterfully lane controlling behemoth of a brawler. She blows fire at enemies, but does not have the typical reload and amount of shots as other brawlers. She has infinite ammo. and incredibly quick reload speeds. This high dps is offset by her relatively low health. Her super allows her to lay down fuel, which could be set off at any moment by her flames. It leaves you burning, dealing even more damage. Her abilities are amazing, as it just accentuates her strongest traits. Her star powers, allow for either the even faster reload of the super or basic attack. Her gadget allows Amber to spill fuel wherever she steps. The collection of these abilities and her great dps, allow her to be one of the strongest legendary brawlers.
