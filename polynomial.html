  <h1>My Favorite Polynomial</h1>
  <p>
    I chose this as my favorite polynomial because it has some of my favorite numbers. I chose 5, to represent the year I was born, which is 2005. I chose 7, to represent my lucky number and my love for the game Mario Kart 7, which was one of the first legit games I've ever played. I chose 16, to show the year that I would turn this year or my next birthday. Lastly I chose 95, to represent my love for Cars and the movie which was my childhood. Lightning McQueen. Kachow! Here's my beautiful table!
