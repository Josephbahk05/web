      Spike
    </h2>
    <p>
    Spike is a sharpshooter that throws cactus grenades that send needles flying. Spike's super creates an area of slow and tick damage made up of cactus spines. Spike has great offensive capabilites, but low health and and a mediocre set of utilities. Spike's star powers allow Spike to regenerate while sitting inside thier own super, or have actively curving attacks, increasing the difficulty of dodging. Spike's gadget allows spike to shoot 3 waves of spikes in all directions.
