      My Favorite Polynomial
    </h1>
    <p>
      I chose this as my favorite polynomial because it has some of my favorite numbers. I chose 5, to represent the year I was born, which is 2005. I chose 7, to represent my lucky number and my love for the game Mario Kart 7, which was one of the first legit games I've ever played. I chose 16, to show the year that I would turn this year or my next birthday. Lastly I chose 95, to represent my love for Cars and the movie which was my childhood. Lightning McQueen. Kachow! Here's my beautiful table!

    right = "<tr><td>"
    mid = "</td><td>"
    left = "</td></tr>\n"
    while start <= end:
        result = (5 * (start**3)) + (7 * (start**2)) + (16 * start) + 95
        table += right + str(start) + mid + str(result) + left
        start += 1

    return table
